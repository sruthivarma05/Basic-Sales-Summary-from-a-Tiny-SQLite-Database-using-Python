# Basic-Sales-Summary-from-a-Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python
This Python script connects to a SQLite database, retrieves total quantity and revenue by product using SQL queries, and visualizes the results with a simple bar chart. It demonstrates how to combine SQL and Python for basic sales analysis and data visualization.
In this task, I created a small SQLite database named sales_data.db and connected to it using Python. I wrote an SQL query to calculate the total quantity sold and total revenue for each product by grouping the sales data. After executing the query, I loaded the results into a pandas DataFrame to easily view and analyze the data. I then printed the summary table to display each productâ€™s performance and used matplotlib to create a simple bar chart showing revenue by product. This visualization helped me quickly understand which products generated the highest sales revenue, demonstrating how SQL and Python can be combined for basic data analysis and reporting.
